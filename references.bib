abstract="The Bayesian network (BN) is a powerful model for probabilistic knowledge representation and inference and is increasingly used in the field of reliability evaluation. This paper presents a bibliographic review of BNs that have been proposed for reliability evaluation in the last decades. Studies are classified from the perspective of the objects of reliability evaluation, i.e., hardware, structures, software, and humans. For each classification, the construction and validation of a BN-based reliability model are emphasized. The general procedural steps for BN-based reliability evaluation, including BN structure modeling, BN parameter modeling, BN inference, and model verification and validation, are investigated. Current gaps and challenges in reliability evaluation with BNs are explored, and a few upcoming research directions that are of interest to reliability researchers are identified.",

abstract = {In this paper, the Conditional Gaussian Networks (CGNs), a form of Bayesian Networks (BN), are used as a statistical process monitoring approach to detect and diagnose faults. The proposed approach improves the structure of Bayesian networks and generalizes a few results regarding statistical tests and the use of an exclusion criterion. The proposed framework is evaluated using data from the benchmark Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP) with various scenarios.}

abstract = {Abstract Belief polarization is said to occur when two people respond to the same evidence by updating their beliefs in opposite directions. This response is considered to be “irrational” because it involves contrary updating, a form of belief updating that appears to violate normatively optimal responding, as for example dictated by Bayes' theorem. In light of much evidence that people are capable of normatively optimal behavior, belief polarization presents a puzzling exception. We show that Bayesian networks, or Bayes nets, can simulate rational belief updating. When fit to experimental data, Bayes nets can help identify the factors that contribute to polarization. We present a study into belief updating concerning the reality of climate change in response to information about the scientific consensus on anthropogenic global warming (AGW). The study used representative samples of Australian and U.S. participants. Among Australians, consensus information partially neutralized the influence of worldview, with free-market supporters showing a greater increase in acceptance of human-caused global warming relative to free-market opponents. In contrast, while consensus information overall had a positive effect on perceived consensus among U.S. participants, there was a reduction in perceived consensus and acceptance of human-caused global warming for strong supporters of unregulated free markets. Fitting a Bayes net model to the data indicated that under a Bayesian framework, free-market support is a significant driver of beliefs about climate change and trust in climate scientists. Further, active distrust of climate scientists among a small number of U.S. conservatives drives contrary updating in response to consensus information among this particular group.},

abstract = {The main objective of sustainable development is to ensure the current and future demand can be satisfied. Food, energy and water is the primary human demand. However, China is facing security issues of water, energy and food due to several economic, social and environmental impacts such as economic progress, population growth and environmental change. For this reason, it is important to evaluate the relationship between food, energy and water with sustainability aspects. Using Bayesian network models, we propose a quantitative analysis framework based on the Water-Energy-Food-Economy-Society-Environment Nexus. Under this framework, the causality relations between water, energy, food and economy, society, environment were studied and quantified. Additionally, the demand for water, energy, food was predicted from a perspective of systematic interaction. Different from previous studies, our research is more comprehensive, involving six subsystems. More importantly, we do research from a systematic point of view. Thirdly, the causality in the nexus was quantified. As a result, we found that water withdrawal is directly affected by population growth and energy demand, indirectly by other nodes in the nexus; energy demand is directly affected by GDP and population growth in the nexus; population growth is the only direct cause of changes in food demand. Projections show that the demand for water, energy and food in China will remain at [600,620) billion cubic meters, a growth rate of [4%, 8%) and [0%, 5%) with an average probability of 0.6772, 0.6128 and 0.7055 respectively from 2020 to 2030.}

abstract = {System safety, reliability and risk analysis are important tasks that are performed throughout the system life-cycle to ensure the dependability of safety-critical systems. Probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) approaches are comprehensive, structured and logical methods widely used for this purpose. PRA approaches include, but not limited to, Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), and Event Tree Analysis (ETA). Growing complexity of modern systems and their capability of behaving dynamically make it challenging for classical PRA techniques to analyse such systems accurately. For a comprehensive and accurate analysis of complex systems, different characteristics such as functional dependencies among components, temporal behaviour of systems, multiple failure modes/states for components/systems, and uncertainty in system behaviour and failure data are needed to be considered. Unfortunately, classical approaches are not capable of accounting for these aspects. Bayesian networks (BNs) have gained popularity in risk assessment applications due to their flexible structure and capability of incorporating most of the above mentioned aspects during analysis. Furthermore, BNs have the ability to perform diagnostic analysis. Petri Nets are another formal graphical and mathematical tool capable of modelling and analysing dynamic behaviour of systems. They are also increasingly used for system safety, reliability and risk evaluation. This paper presents a review of the applications of Bayesian networks and Petri nets in system safety, reliability and risk assessments. The review highlights the potential usefulness of the BN and PN based approaches over other classical approaches, and relative strengths and weaknesses in different practical application scenarios.}
