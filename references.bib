abstract="The Bayesian network (BN) is a powerful model for probabilistic knowledge representation and inference and is increasingly used in the field of reliability evaluation. This paper presents a bibliographic review of BNs that have been proposed for reliability evaluation in the last decades. Studies are classified from the perspective of the objects of reliability evaluation, i.e., hardware, structures, software, and humans. For each classification, the construction and validation of a BN-based reliability model are emphasized. The general procedural steps for BN-based reliability evaluation, including BN structure modeling, BN parameter modeling, BN inference, and model verification and validation, are investigated. Current gaps and challenges in reliability evaluation with BNs are explored, and a few upcoming research directions that are of interest to reliability researchers are identified.",

abstract = {In this paper, the Conditional Gaussian Networks (CGNs), a form of Bayesian Networks (BN), are used as a statistical process monitoring approach to detect and diagnose faults. The proposed approach improves the structure of Bayesian networks and generalizes a few results regarding statistical tests and the use of an exclusion criterion. The proposed framework is evaluated using data from the benchmark Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP) with various scenarios.}

abstract = {Abstract Belief polarization is said to occur when two people respond to the same evidence by updating their beliefs in opposite directions. This response is considered to be “irrational” because it involves contrary updating, a form of belief updating that appears to violate normatively optimal responding, as for example dictated by Bayes' theorem. In light of much evidence that people are capable of normatively optimal behavior, belief polarization presents a puzzling exception. We show that Bayesian networks, or Bayes nets, can simulate rational belief updating. When fit to experimental data, Bayes nets can help identify the factors that contribute to polarization. We present a study into belief updating concerning the reality of climate change in response to information about the scientific consensus on anthropogenic global warming (AGW). The study used representative samples of Australian and U.S. participants. Among Australians, consensus information partially neutralized the influence of worldview, with free-market supporters showing a greater increase in acceptance of human-caused global warming relative to free-market opponents. In contrast, while consensus information overall had a positive effect on perceived consensus among U.S. participants, there was a reduction in perceived consensus and acceptance of human-caused global warming for strong supporters of unregulated free markets. Fitting a Bayes net model to the data indicated that under a Bayesian framework, free-market support is a significant driver of beliefs about climate change and trust in climate scientists. Further, active distrust of climate scientists among a small number of U.S. conservatives drives contrary updating in response to consensus information among this particular group.},
